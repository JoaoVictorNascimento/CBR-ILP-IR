%X Building a methodology for developing and maintaining CBR applications is an important goal currently addressed by CBR researchers and practitioners. Since CBR application development is a special kind of software development, building a CBR methodology can certainly be viewed as a software engineering research and development activity. This paper presents a perspective of how software process modeling, which is a recent approach in software engineering, can be used for building a case-based reasoning methodology. Further we describe a case study to show the applicability of the proposed concepts.
