%X We present and analyze the star clustering algorithm. We discuss an implementation of this algorithm that supports browsing and document retrieval through information organization. We define three parameters for evaluating a clustering algorithm to measure the topic separation and topic aggregation achieved by the algorithm. In the absence of benchmarks, we present a method for randomly generating clustering data. Data from our user study shows evidence that the star algorithm is effective for organizing information.
