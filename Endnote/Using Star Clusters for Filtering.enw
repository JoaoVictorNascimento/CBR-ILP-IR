%X We examine applications of clustering to the filtering task. We use the on-line version of the star algorithm [JPR98, JPR99] as the clustering tool because this algorithm computes, with high precision, naturally occuring topics in a collection and it admits an efficient on-line solution for dynamic corpora. We describe several filtering algorithms and show extensive experimental results using the TREC collection.
