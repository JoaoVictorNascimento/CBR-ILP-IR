%X Musical genres are categorical descriptions that are used todescribe  music.  They  are  commonly  used  to  structure  theincreasing amounts of music available in digital form on theWeb  and  are  important  for  music  information  retrieval.Genre   categorization   for   audio   has   traditionally   beenperformed    manually.    A    particular    musical    genre    ischaracterized   by    statistical   properties    related   to   theinstrumentation,    rhythmic    structure    and    form    of    itsmembers.  In  this  work,  algorithms  for  the  automatic  genrecategorization   of   audio   signals   are   described.      Morespecifically,  we  propose  a  set  of  features  for  representingtexture  and  instrumentation.  In  addition  a  novel  set  offeatures  for  representing  rhythmic  structure  and  strength  isproposed.  The  performance  of  those  feature  sets  has  beenevaluated    by    training    statistical    pattern    recognitionclassifiers using real world audio collections.  Based on theautomatic  hierarchical  genre  classification  two  graphicaluser  interfaces  for  browsing  and  interacting  with  largeaudio collections have been developed.
