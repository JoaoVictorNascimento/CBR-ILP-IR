%T Lexical Semantics in the Age of the Semantic Web
%D 2001
%A Buitelaar, Paul
%X Lexical semantics is the study of word meaning. The semantic web is a vision of what the web could be if it would foremost consist of knowledge (structured data) rather than text or other unstructured data as it is today. This talk is about the future of word meaning if the semantic web becomes a reality. First, I will therefore briefly clarify what the semantic web vision consists of, followed by a sketch of lexical semantics. Finally, I will speculate on how the inherent semantic standardization process of the semantic web could have a dramatic influence on the study and use of word meaning.
