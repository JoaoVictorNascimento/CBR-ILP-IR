%X An exemplar-based model with foundations in Bayesian networks is described. The proposed model utilises two Bayesian networks: one for indexing of categories, and another for identifying exemplars within categories. Learning is incrementally conducted each time a new case is classified. The representation structure dynamically changes each time a new case is classified and a coverage function is used as a basis for selecting suitable exemplars. Finally, a simple example is given to illustrate the concepts in the model.
