%T SCAN YOUR LIFE: Integrating OCR into your Personal Haystack!
%D 2000
%A Holt, A. L.
%X built a self-serve OCR station where anybody can scan in documents at high-speed -- a public yet private ATM that accepts document deposits of a wider assortment than just checks. Depending on whether you scan a business card, an article or your entire filing cabinet, CPU-intensive recognition continues after you leave the station, and you are emailed options for secure web pickup. Users of MIT's Haystack personal repositories can even do "1-click" merging of o ine literary artifacts into their online lives. The paperless pipe dream may never happen, but cheap digital optics and a mundane 40-year old technology (OCR) are converging to change the game. The mindless convenience of my $6000 kiosk suggests OCR will become a regulated munition in the coming intellectual property and privacy wars. As OCR proliferates into cheap PDA's, neither publisher nor individual may ever again rely on humanity's oldest form of copy protection: paper.
