%X In this paper, a new approach is proposed for transformational adaptation based on detecting a solutionâ€™s incompatibility regarding the new problem situation and trying to overcome the incompatibility in an iterative manner. By incompatibility, we mean a state for which the required objectives are not satisfied due to any change in the status of the constraints. Based upon this approach, we have proposed a framework for redesigning an existing system under new constraints. To show the capability of this framework, a software prototype was developed that it is capable of redesigning an existing digital circuit under presence of new constraints, e.g. type of gates, power dissipation, fan in/out, gate prices and so on.
