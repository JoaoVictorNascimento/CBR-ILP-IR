%X Recommender systems combine user profiling and filtering techniques to provide more pro-active and personal information retrieval systems, and have been gaining in popularity as a way of overcoming the ubiquitous information overload problem. Many recommender systems operate as interactive systems that seek feedback from the end-user as part of the recommendation process to revise the userâ€™s query. In this paper we examine different forms of feedback that have been used in the past and focus on a low-cost preference-based feedback model, which to date has been very much under utilised. In particular we describe and evaluate a novel comparison-based recommendation framework which is designed to utilise preference-based feedback. Specifically, we present results that highlight the benefits of a number of new query revision strategies and evidence to suggest that the popular more-like-this strategy may be flawed.
