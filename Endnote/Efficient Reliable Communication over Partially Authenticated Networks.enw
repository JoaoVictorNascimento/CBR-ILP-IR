%X Reliable communication between processors in a network is a basic requirement for executing any protocol. Dolev [7] and Dolev etÂ al. [8] showed that reliable communication is possible if and only if the communication network is sufficiently connected. Beimel and Franklin [1] showed that the connectivity requirement can be relaxed if some pairs of processors share authentication keys. That is, costly communication channels can be replaced by authentication keys.
