%X We propose a probabilistic case-space metric for the case matching and case adaptation tasks. Central to our approach is a probability propagation algorithm adopted from Bayesian reasoning systems, which allows our case-based reasoning system to perform theoretically sound probabilistic reasoning. The same probability propagation mechanism actually offers a uniform solution to both the case matching and case adaptation problems. We also show how the algorithm can be implemented as a connectionist network, where efficient massively parallel case retrieval is an inherent property of the system. We argue that using this kind of an approach, the difficult problem of case indexing can be completely avoided.
