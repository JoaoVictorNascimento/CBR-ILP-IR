%X This paper presents a novel approach to determine structural similarity as guidance for adaptation in case-based reasoning (Cbr). We advance structural similarity assessment which provides not only a single numeric value but the most specific structure two cases have in common, inclusive of the modification rules needed to obtain this structure from the two cases. Our approach treats retrieval, matching, and adaptation as a group of dependent processes. This guarantees the retrieval and matching of not only similar but adaptable cases. Both together enlarge the overall problem solving performance of Cbr and the explainability of case selection and adaptation considerably. Although our approach is more theoretical in nature and not restricted to a specific domain, we will give an example taken from the domain of industrial building design. Additionally, we will sketch two prototypical implementations of the approach.
