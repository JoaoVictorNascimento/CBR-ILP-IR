%X We describe an unsupervised semantic tagger, applied to German, but which could be used with any language for which a corresponding "XNet" (WordNet, GermaNet, etc.), POS tagger and morphological analyzer are available. Disambiguation is performed by comparing co-occurrence weights on pairs of semantic classes (synsets from GermaNet). Precision is around 67% at a recall of around 65% (for all ambiguous words -81% for all words at a recall of 80%). Our results show the influence of context size and of semantic class frequency in the training corpus.
