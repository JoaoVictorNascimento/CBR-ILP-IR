%X Most applications of inductive logic programming focus on prediction or the discovery of new knowledge. We describe a less common application of ILP namely verification and validation of knowledge based systems and multi-agent systems. Using inductive logic programming, partial declarative specifications of the software can be induced from the behaviour of the software. These rules can be readily interpreted by the designers or users of the software, and can in turn result in changes to the software. The approach outlined was tested in the domain of multi-agent systems, more in particular the RoboCup domain.
