%X Establishing the semantic web on a large scale implies the widespread annotation of web documents with ontology-based knowledge markup. For this purpose, tools have been developed that allow for semi-automatic annotation of web documents with ontology-based metadata. However, given that a large number of web documents consist either fully or at least partially of free text, language technology tools will be needed to support this authoring process by providing an automatic analysis of the semantic structure of textual documents. In this way, free text documents will become available as semi-structured documents, from which meaningful units can be extracted automatically (information extraction) and organized through clustering or classification (text mining). Obviously, this is of importance for both knowledge markup and ontology development, i.e. the dynamic adaptation of ontologies to evolving applications and domains. In this paper we present the following linguistic analysis steps that underlie both of these: morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, chunking, dependency structure analysis, semantic tagging. Examples for each are given in the context of two projects that use linguistic and semantic annotation for the purpose of cross-lingual information retrieval and content-based multimedia access.
