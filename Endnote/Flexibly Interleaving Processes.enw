%X We discuss several problems of analogy-driven proof plan construction which prevent a solution for more difficult target problems or make a solution very expensive. Some of these problems are due to the previously assumed fixed order of matching, reformulation, and replay in case-based reasoning and from a too restricted combination of planning from first principles with the analogy process. In order to overcome these problems we suggest to interleave matching and replay as well as casebased planning with planning from first principles.
