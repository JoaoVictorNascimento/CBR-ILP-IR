%X This paper describes our retrieval system for NTCIR-2 Japanese/English CLIR and MLIR tasks. We integrate query and document translation with monolingual retrieval to improve retrieval accuracy, and perform clustering to improve browsing efficiency. We also introduce an entropy-driven technique in evaluating clustering methods.
