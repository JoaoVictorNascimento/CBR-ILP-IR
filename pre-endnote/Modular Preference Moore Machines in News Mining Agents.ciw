DT Proceedings Paper
AB This paper focuses on Hybrid Symbolic Neural Architectures that support the task of classifying textual information in learning agents. We give an outline of these symbolic and neural preference Moore machines. Furthermore, we demonstrate how they can be used in the context of information mining and news classification. Using the Reuters newswire text data, we demonstrate how hybrid symbolic and neural machines can provide an effective foundation for learning news agents.
